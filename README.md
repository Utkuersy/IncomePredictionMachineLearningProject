# Income Prediction Machine Learning Project

## 📌 About the Project
This project focuses on predicting an individual's income category using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on demographic and economic features to classify whether a person earns above or below a certain income threshold.

## 📊 Technologies Used
- **Python** – Core programming language
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data preprocessing and manipulation
- **Scikit-Learn** – Machine learning model development
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Experimentation and analysis

## 🔍 Project Features
This project includes the following steps:
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding feature relationships and distributions
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Implementing various machine learning algorithms
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model performance
- **Prediction & Insights**: Analyzing model outputs and key influencing factors
